## Assembly
### Step 1: Attaching the Cane Mount
1. (if using a collapsible cane) extend the cane.
2. Prepare the cane mount. If the large, non-slip, Velcro strap is not already threaded through the cane mount, you will attach this first. Holding the cane mount vertically, the ‘front’ of the mount has a ribbed/bumpy vertical channel and the ‘back’ has a smooth concave vertical channel. A ‘wing’ sticks out from each side of the mount. Thread the strap through one wing of the mount from front to back. The gummy side of the strap should face the mount, while the Velcro side should face outward.
3. Loosely secure the cane mount to the cane. Hold the cane vertically with the handle facing up and the tip on the ground. Hold the cane mount vertically with the raised end facing up and the recessed end pointing down, then place the mount against the cane so that the smooth concave channel is pressed against the cane. Wrap the mount strap around the cane and thread it through the open side of the mount. Thread the strap through the plastic buckle on the end of the strap. 
4. Align the cane mount. Wrap your hand around the top of the cane just below the handle. With your other hand, slide the cane mount up until it touches the hand on the cane. You may need to loosen the strap on the mount a little to help it slide. Using your hand as a guide will help to align the mount so there will be room to plug in the wireless transmitter.
5. Fully secure the cane mount. Hold the mount in place with one hand to keep it in place. With the other hand, pull the strap tight. Wrap the strap back around the cane, with the Velcro side facing in and the gummy side facing out, and secure the Velcro. The cane mount should now be securely attached to the cane.
### Step 2: Attaching the Mic
1. Make sure the microphone cable is not tangled. 
2. Clip on the microphone to the bottom of the cane, just above the cane tip.
3. Plug the metal plug of the microphone cable into the cane mount’s inset port (facing the bottom of the cane).
4. Secure the cable along the length of the cane with small Velcro straps. There should be 4 straps already looped onto the cable. Use the 3 lower ones, leaving the 4th for later (next step).
5. Bunch up the excess cable below the cane mount and secure with the 4th small Velcro strap.
### Step 3: Powering the Amplifier
1. Place the amplifier so you are facing the front. You should be able to feel the textured front grill on the face closest to you. From this position, there are inputs on the back of the amplifier, located in a divot on the top center of the back face.
2. Plug the power brick into the wall. The amplifier has a large, boxy, power brick. The thicker cable running off it plugs into a wall outlet.
3. Plug the power plug into the amplifier. The thinner cable coming off the power brick has a barrel connector (metal tube) that plugs into the amplifier. The power input jack on the amplifier is the leftmost port on the back and is a raised square with a circular hole in the middle. Plug the power cable into the power input jack.
4. Locate the power switch. With the amplifier facing you, the controls run along the back edge of the top face. Behind the leftmost amplifier control is a metal toggle switch. Move it to the “up” position to turn the amplifier on, and the ‘down’ position to turn it off.
### Step 4: Connecting the Wireless System (do this just before a practice/performance)
1. Pair the wireless transmitter and receiver. The wireless system automatically connects and adjusts to the space you are in. To pair the transmitter and receiver, plug the transmitter into the receiver and wait 20-30 seconds before unplugging them. The pairing will take about 12 seconds, so waiting a little longer helps ensure that a connection has been made.
2. Plug the transmitter into the cane. Hold the cane mount steady and plug the transmitter into the raised port (facing up to the cane handle) on the mount. The transmitter should click into place. The transmitter turns on automatically when you plug it into the cane, so only do this when you are ready to use the system.
3. Plug the receiver into the amplifier. With the amplifier facing you, the controls run along the back edge of the top. There is a ¼” jack to the right of the controls. Plug the receiver into the jack. The receiver turns on automatically when you plug it into the amplifier, so only do this when you are ready to use the system
4. Test the connection. Turn on the amplifier. After a second or two, you should be able to hear sounds from the cane coming out of the amplifier. If you do not, try adjusting the gain or output volume controls on the amplifier. If you still do not hear anything or the sound cuts out, the wireless system may not be working. You can try to repair the transmitter and receiver, but you will likely need to switch to the backup cable.
5. (if needed) Switch to the backup cable. If the wireless system is not charged or you cannot get a solid connection in the space you are in, you may need to use a wired connection instead. To do this, unplug the transmitter and receiver. Plug one end of the ¼” to ¼” audio cable into the raised port on the cane mount (where the transmitter was), and the other into the ¼” input jack on the amplifier (where the receiver was). The provided cable is fairly short and will restrict movement, but it can be replaced with a longer one if you find yourself in locations where the wireless system is often non-functional. 
## Charging the Wireless System
### Step 1: Connecting the Transmitter and Receiver
1. Locate the transmitter port on the receiver. Next to the metal plug on the receiver is a ¼” jack, which feels like a round hole. 
2. Plug the transmitter into the ¼” jack on the receiver.
### Step 2: Charging
1. Locate the charging port and cable. Both the transmitter and receiver have micro USB ports for charging, but with the transmitter plugged into the receiver, connecting power to the receiver charges both devices. The receiver’s charging port is a slightly rectangular hole one the face opposite the faceted side of the device. The power cable is a short micro USB cable, of which the smaller end (has sharp parts) plugs into the receiver. 
2. Plug the micro USB cable into the receiver.
3. Plug the USB end of the micro USB cable into a computer or other powered USB port
4. Wait at least 5 hours for the wireless system to fully charge. It will stop charging when full. The battery on the wireless system will last about 8-10 hours.
